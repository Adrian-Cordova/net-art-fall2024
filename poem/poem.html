            <p>TYRION: Father, I wish to confess! <em>(shouting over the crowd) I wish to confess.</em>
            </p>
            <p><em>The crowd chatter dies down.
            </em></p>
            <p><em>Tywin regards Tyrion for a beat. Tyrion looks up at the three judges.
            </em></p>
            <p>TYWIN: You wish to confess?
            </p>
            <p><em>Tyrion gazes out at the crowd, who are taking such pleasure in his destruction.
            </em></p>
            <p>TYRION (to the crowd): I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all--</p>
            <p>TYWIN: <em>Tyrion</em>. Do you wish to confess?
            </p>
            <p><em>Tyrion turns to face Tywin.
            </em></p>
            <p>TYRION: Yes, father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?
            </p>
            <p>TYWIN: You admit you poisoned the King?
            </p>
            <p>TYRION: No, of that I'm innocent. I am guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.
            </p>
            <p>TYWIN: You are not on trial for being a dwarf.</p>
            <p>TYRION: Oh, yes I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.</p>
            <p>TYWIN: Have you nothing to say in your defense?
            </p>
            <p>TYRION: Nothing but this: I did not do it.
            </p>
            <p><em>He turns from his father to Cersei.
            </em></p>
            <p>TYRION: I did not kill Joffrey but I wish that I had. Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores.</p>
            <p><em>Cersei has never hated Tyrion more than in this moment.</em></p>
            <p><em>Tyrion turns from her and looks out at the crowd of nobles.</em></p>
            <p>TYRION: I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
            </p>
            <p><em>Uproar from the crowd <ul><b><li>Killer!</li> <li>Kingslayer!</li> <li>Monster!</li></b></ul>
            </em></p>
            <p>TYWIN <em>(shouting over the crowd, to Meryn Trant)</em>: Ser Meryn, escort the prisoner back to his cell--</p>
            <p>TYRION: I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here, so I will let the gods decide my fate. (beat)
                I demand a trial by combat!</p>
            <p><em>The roar of the crowd is deafening.
            </em></p>
            <p><em>Jaime shuts his eyes. Any hope of saving Tyrion is gone.
            </em></p>
            <p><em>Cersei smiles, triumphant at having pushed him too far.
            </em></p>
            <p><em>Oberyn Martell leans forward, intrigued.</em></p>
            <p><em>As for Tywin: he stares straight ahead, in dark hatred, at his youngest son.</em></p>
            <p><em>And Tyrion Lannister, defiant, stares right back.</em></p>
